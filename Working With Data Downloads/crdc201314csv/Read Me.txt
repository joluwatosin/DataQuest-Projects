About the CRDC Data:
The Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) is a biennial (i.e., every other school year) survey required by the U.S. Department of Education’s (Department) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) since 1968. Similar to the 2011–12 CRDC, the 2013–14 CRDC collected data from a universe of all public local educational agencies (LEA) and schools, including long-term secure juvenile justice facilities, charter schools, alternative schools, and schools serving students with disabilities. 

The CRDC collects data on leading civil rights indicators related to access and barriers to educational opportunity at the early childhood through grade 12 levels. The CRDC is also a longstanding and critical aspect of the overall enforcement and monitoring strategy used by OCR to ensure that recipients of the Department’s Federal financial assistance do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and disability. OCR relies on CRDC data it receives from public school districts as it investigates complaints alleging discrimination, determines whether the Federal civil rights laws it enforces have been violated, initiates proactive compliance reviews to focus on particularly acute or nationwide civil rights compliance problems, and provides policy guidance and technical assistance to educational institutions, parents, students, and others. In addition, the CRDC is a valuable resource for other Department offices and Federal agencies, policymakers and researchers, educators and school officials, parents and students, and the public who seek data on student equity and opportunity. 

Data Corrections:
OCR generally does not allow districts to make amendments to the data after the close of the collection. However, OCR recognizes that minor corrections to the data may be necessary. As part of the 2013-14 CRDC process, districts were allowed to submit data corrections for up to one year after the data submission period closed. A data correction is defined as revised data for a data element (e.g., enrollment numbers for female students). 

Following is a summary of data corrections that were incorporated into the data. The following updates were made in the May 2017 data release.
